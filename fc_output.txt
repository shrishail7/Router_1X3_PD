ARGUMENTS
       pattern_name
              Specifies the name of the standard cell rail connection pattern.

       -rail_width {top_width | @var1 bottom_width | @var2}
              Specifies the top cell row rail width and bottom cell row width.
              This option is optional. By default, the tool uses  the  longest
              PG pin width. The units are defined in the technology file. Each
              width can also be specified by  evaluating  the  var1  and  var2
              variables in -parameters option. The at character (@) is used as
              a prefix to evaluate the variable. If only one width  is  speci-
              fied, it is applied to both top and bottom width values. If rail
              width is not specified, the standard cell pin width is  used  by
              default.  This option is required when a design does not contain
              any standard cells.

       -rail_shift {top_shift | @var1 bottom_shift | @var2}
              Specifies the shift distance of rails. The units are defined  in
              the  technology  file.  The  rail shift can also be specified by
              evaluating the  var1  and  var2  variables  in  the  -parameters
              option. The at character (@) is used as a prefix to evaluate the
              variable. A positive distance shifts the bottom  and  top  rails
              into  the  cell  rows. A negative distance shifts the bottom and
              top rails out from the cell rows. If only  one  shift  value  is
              specified,  it  is  applied to both top and bottom shift values.
              The shift value is applied to the center of rail with respect to
              the row boundary, that is, a shift value of 0 can align the cen-
              ter of rail with the row boundary. By  default,  the  rails  are
              aligned with standard cell pins.

       -rail_mask {top_mask | @var1 bottom_mask | @var2}
              Specifies  the  top cell row rail mask and bottom cell row mask.
              This option is optional. By default, the  rail  is  not  colored
              with  any  mask.   Each mask can also be specified by evaluating
              the var1 and var2 variables in -parameters option. The at  char-
              acter  (@) is used as a prefix to evaluate the variable. If only
              one mask is specified, it is applied  to  both  top  and  bottom
              masks.  The  valid  keyword  for  rail  mask is one of mask_one,
              mask_two, mask_three  and  follow_pin.  "follow_pin"  refers  to
              assigning  same  mask of std cell pins to std rails. Report com-
              mand report_pg_patterns reports the rail mask in the same order,
              i.e.  top and bottom masks.

       -layers layers | @var
              Specifies  the list of layer names for standard cell connection.
              By default, the standard cell power ground pin layer is used for
              connection.  The  list  of layers can be specified by evaluating
              the variable @var. The variable var is specified in  -parameters
              option.  The  at  character  (@)  is used as a prefix keyword to
              evaluate the variable. If layers are not specified, the standard
              cell  pin  layer  is  used  for  rail  creation.  This option is
              required when a design does not contain any standard cells.

       -check_std_cell_drc true | false | @var
              Specifies the option to check DRCs  between  the  rail  and  the
              standard  cells.  For example, if standard cells are not placed,
              the DRCs between standard cell pins and PG rails can be ignored.
              This  option  can be set to "true", "false" or by evaluating the
              var variable in the -parameters option. The at character (@)  is
              used  as  a prefix keyword to evaluate the variable. By default,
              the option is "false", and DRCs between rails and standard cells
              are ignored for faster runtime.

       -mark_as_follow_pin true | false | @var
              Specifies  the  output  shape_use of the generated rails. If set
              the   option   false,   the    generated    rail    will    have
              "lib_cell_pin_connect" attribute in shape_use. If it is true, it
              will be "follow_pin". The at character (@) is used as  a  prefix
              keyword  to  evaluate  the  variable.  By default, the option is
              "false".

       -parameters var_list
              Specifies the list of parameters. Each parameter can  be  evalu-
              ated  and used by other options in this command. This allows the
              pattern to be  programmable  and  reused  by  passing  different
              parameters  in  different  situations. Each parameter var in the
              list var_list is a string and the at character (@) is used as  a
              prefix  to evaluate the parameter, such as @var. See the example
              section for more details.

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a standard cell connection pattern. This pattern can be instan-
       tiated  in  a  design by the set_pg_strategy command to create standard
       cell connections. For standard cell rails, macro and pad pins  are  not
       connected and floating segments are always kept.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  creates  a  standard  cell  connection pattern
       std_pattern_1 at layer M1.

         prompt> create_pg_std_cell_conn_pattern \
            std_pattern_1 \
            -layers {M1}

       The following example creates a standard cell connection pattern  named
       std_pattern_2 at a programmable layer by using the parameter my_metal2.
       The rail width and shift distance are also specified by  parameters,  w
       and  dist,  respectively.  When  referring  to  this  pattern  with the
       set_pg_strategy command, you can program the actual layer name for  the
       metal  layer,  for example "Metal2" or "M2". Parameters allow this pat-
       tern to be reused by designs with different technologies.

         prompt> create_pg_std_cell_conn_pattern \
            std_pattern_2 \
            -parameters {my_metal2 w dist} \
            -layers {@my_metal2} \
            -rail_width {@w @w} \
            -rail_shift {@dist}
         prompt> set_pg_strategy \
            s1 \
            -core \
            -pattern {{name: std_pattern_2}{nets: VDD}{parameters: {M2 2 10}}} \
            -extension {{stop: 10} {layers: M2}}
